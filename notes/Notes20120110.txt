Google Collections 1/2:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeO_J2OcHYM

Bloch is still all proud of the Java Collections library.

Bloch:  "The basic idea was that it was extensible...it has happened,
but it really blossomed with Kevin's framework"

1.  Minimize mutability
2.  When in doubt, leave it out
3.  Know and use the libraries

Kevin Bourrillion and Jared Levy

java.util is the bedrock for Google Collections

Immutable Collections
 Multisets
 Multimaps

Unmodifiable vs Immutable
 Unmodifiable wrapper types in Java
   - YOU can't change it through this reference, but it can be changed (behind your back).
 Immutable - no one can change this

Immutable Collections
 ImmutableList
 ImmutableSet
 ImmutableSortedSet
 ImmutableMap
 ImmutableSortedMap - didn't exist for the presentation, exists now.

He asserts his collections use far less memory (2 to 3x for an ImmutableSet)

13:15  ImmutableSet<Integer> i = ImmutableSet.of( 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 );

I liked the explanation about "why is it ImmutableSet<Integer> rather
than just Set<Integer>"...its because ImmutableSet conveys behavior

.of() and .with() are cool, but at Guava 11 .with() does not exist.  ImmutableMap.Builder replaces it?

None of them have public constructors, they don't want you to subclass
them, so the classes themselves aren't final, but no public
constructors keeps you from subclassing /* how? */

.of(), .with(), .copyOf()

On the Map, .of() is not var args, there are overloaded methods for
args up to 5.  Beyond 5, go with the builder.

Caveats
 - These collections do not like nulls
 - The collections are immutable, the stuff you put in them may not be.

MultiSets and MultiMaps
 - a type of collection

  Can it have duplicates?
  Is ordering significant ( for .equals() )?
  Iteration order?
    insertion-ordered?
    comparator-ordered?
    user-ordered?
    something else?
    i don't care!

  MultiSet - fills the "Duplicates Y, Ordered N" slot
  (UniqueList) - fills the Duplicates N, Ordered Y" slot, but doesn't exist (even in 11)

  Most popular use for Multiset is Integer valued Histogram structures

35:53 shows the traditional way to do this Histogram

/* tags.count() vs tags.getCount().  Does this make it Groovy hostile? */

The video 2/2 shows 6 implementation of Multiset, Guava 11 has 7:
  ImmutableMultiset
  HashMultiset ( .hashCode() and .equals() )
  LinkedHashMultiset
  TreeMultiset ( Comparator )
  EnumMultiset ( are your elements Enums? )
  ConcurrentHashMultiset
  ForwardingMultiset (not on video)

Kevin B:  "I don't know what JSTL is..." /* make bob sad */

MultiMap

  Confusion reigns at 08:30 with "key has multiple values".  I find it easiest to think Multimap as <K,List<V>>.

  Suspend at 10:33 of 2/2.

ConcurrentMultiMap

2/2 @06:08  

/* Hmmm.  <Salesperson, List<Sale>> conveys more information to me */

Kevin is not a fan of constructors.  The collections library gives us
a way; static factory methods.

Multimaps havve View collections Collections.max example at 15:13

Ordering "an upgrade of a Comparator"

Static Factory Methods out the wazoo
 - Static methods have type inference
 - The most popular thing in the whole library
 /* RIGHT HERE ROBERT @ 28:00 */

Iterator/Iterable when you don't want a collection but you want to
iterate over something (Stream)

/* Precondition Checking?!? */

25,000 unit tests!! @ 37:50 shows a feature/builder/thing.

  Tried to build Guava from git repository, no joy.

  JARs are readily available but you've got to poke around a little for javadoc and source.
    I found the JavaDoc and Source JARs on the release page:
      http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/Release11

  It looks like they really want you to use Maven.
    /* How many folks use Maven to do their dependencies?  Do you use it for more than this?  Does it do the build too? */

  The Guava wiki has what looks to be the elusive agenda I've been searching for:
    http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/GuavaExplained
    
  Another list maintained by some third party guy:
    http://www.tfnico.com/presentations/google-guava
    
2012-01-08:  GuavaExplained, Basics, UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained
  Guava's utilities are designed to fail-fast in the presence of null

  Guava Optional<T> is a way of replacing a nullable T reference with a non-null value.

  /* Guava is a celebration of static factory methods...I really would like to understand the comment about static methods and type inference.  The deeper I get, the more it seems like a celebration of static methods in general. */

  Guava Preconditions
    checkNotNull( T ) has a cool feature of returning the value directly
    checkArgument( boolean ) and checkState( boolean ) vary only in the exception they throw; IllegalArgumentException vs IllegalStateException
